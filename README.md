NGO management system
About : This project was built to help NGOs maintain a database for their various donations and possible projects. It enlists the 
        the projects that are run by the ngo that require either monetary support or support in any other way.
        The project has a website that helps users login with their credentials and then gain access to the various running and upcoming 
        projects, along with the support they require. They could then decide the donation they wish they give.
        
Technologies used:
a) Front end: used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to develop the front end
b) Back end: used MySQL for the database and Flask (a Python framework) for linking the front end to the database.
